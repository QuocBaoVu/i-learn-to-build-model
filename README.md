# I Learn to Build Models â€” From Scratch

Welcome! This repository is a personal journey where I build and document **machine learning models from scratch** using core Python and NumPy.  
The goal is to move beyond just using libraries like `scikit-learn` or `PyTorch`, and instead understand **how models actually work under the hood**.

## Goals of This Repository

- Learn and implement core ML models **from first principles**
- Understand the math behind each algorithm
- Practice gradient-based optimization (e.g., gradient descent)
- Build portfolio-ready projects with clean structure and visualization
- Document each model in a **Jupyter Notebook** for clarity and teaching value

## Completed Models

| Model               | From Scratch | Notebook | Evaluation |
|--------------------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Linear Regression  | DONE           | ðŸ““ [View](./linear-regression/linear-regression.ipynb) | RMSE, RÂ² |

> More models coming soon:
> - Logistic Regression  
> - k-Nearest Neighbors  
> - Decision Trees  
> - Naive Bayes  
> - Neural Networks (Basic)
